# p5.js Starter

Minimal project to get started with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
Includes live reloading with [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

After installing the dependencies via `npm install` or `yarn`, simply run

```sh
npm start
```

to start the development server. Put all of your p5.js related code (i.e. your sketch) in `sketch.js`. Happy sketching! ⚡️
